                <P>No poverty is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aimed at<br> 
                  eradicating extreme poverty and reducing poverty in all its forms<br>
                  by providing access to basic resources, services, and opportunities for <br>
                  people to improve their lives. It requires policies and programs that address <br>
                  the root causes of poverty, including investing in social protection systems, <br>
                 creating jobs, promoting economic growth, reducing inequalities, and empowering marginalized groups.</P>
    </div>
    <div class="d5"><a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/"><img src="images/no hunger2.png"></a>
        <P>The "No Hunger" Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 2) <br>
            aims to end hunger, improve nutrition and promote sustainable <br>
            agriculture by 2030. It requires a holistic approach that addresses <br>
            the root causes of hunger and malnutrition, including poverty, conflict,<br>
             and climate change, while also improving food systems and <br>
             promoting sustainable agricultural practices.</P>

    <div class="d6"><a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/"><img src="images/gd health3.png"></a>
        <P>The Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) is one of the 17 goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015.<br>
             It aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages by 2030. <br>
             Achieving this goal requires increasing access to quality healthcare, reducing the burden of<br>
              communicable and non-communicable diseases, improving maternal and child health, and addressing <br>
              the social determinants of health.
    </div>
    
    <div class="d7"><a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/"><img src="images/quality education4.png"></a>
        <P>Quality education is essential for personal and societal development. <br>
            It equips individuals with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values<br>
             to succeed in life and contribute to their communities. A quality education <br>
             should be accessible, equitable, inclusive, and learner-centered, <br>
             and should foster critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and <br>
             collaboration. It should also promote lifelong learning and prepare learners<br>
              for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.

    <div class="d8"><a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/"><img src="images/gender equality5.png"></a>
        <P>Gender equality is the idea that everyone, regardless of their gender, <br>
            should have equal rights, opportunities, and responsibilities. <br>
            It involves challenging gender stereotypes, eliminating discrimination and<br>
             violence based on gender, and promoting equal access to education, healthcare,<br>
              and employment. Gender equality is important because it promotes social justice, <br>
              empowers individuals, and benefits society as a whole by reducing poverty,<br>
               improving health outcomes, and increasing economic growth and stability.

        <P>Clean water and sanitation are basic human needs that are critical for good health <br>
            and a decent standard of living. However, access to clean water and<br>
             sanitation is still a challenge in many parts of the world. To address this,<br>
              it is necessary to invest in infrastructure and promote education and awareness,<br>
               to ensure that everyone has access to clean water and sanitation facilities,<br>
                regardless of their location, socioeconomic status, or gender.

             promoting social inclusion, and achieving sustainable development.<br>
              To achieve this, it is necessary to create an enabling environment for<br>
               economic growth, invest in education and training, and promote<br>
                labor rights and social protection. By doing so, we can ensure that<br>

    <div class="d13"><a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/"><img src="images/inequality10.png"></a>
        <P>Inequality is a multifaceted issue that can harm individuals and society,<br>
             but policies such as taxation, safety nets, and education and training programs<br>
              can address it. Addressing inequality can promote social stability,<br>
               economic growth, and overall well-being, and is increasingly<br>
                recognized as a key aspect of sustainable development.

             It involves ensuring access to basic services for all residents, reducing crime,<br>
              preparing for disasters, and promoting environmental protection.<br>
               This requires collaboration between multiple stakeholders, including governments,<br>
                businesses, civil society organizations, and residents.
    </div>
    <div class="d15"><a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/"><img src="images/production12.png"></a>
        <P>Sustainable consumption and production is critical for achieving sustainable<br>
             development goals and involves minimizing waste, promoting efficiency,<br>
              and adopting sustainable practices throughout the supply chain.<br>
               It can lead to cost savings, increased competitiveness, and improved <br>
               social and environmental outcomes, with consumer behavior and demand <br>
               playing a vital role. Governments and businesses have a responsibility<br>
                to promote and support sustainable consumption and production practices.

             weather patterns and temperatures due to human activities,<br>
              causing negative impacts on the environment, health, and economy.<br>
               Addressing climate change requires reducing greenhouse <br>
               gas emissions, increasing renewable energy use, and implementing<br>
                sustainability policies, which require global cooperation
    </div>

            basic services for all. Achieving this goal requires addressing<br>
             discrimination, violence, and corruption. Governments, civil society,<br>
